# Brain
This is the location where the brain will get saved after it is processed.

The reason we need to save it, is so that every sequential startup will be much much faster.


## Why is the folder empty?
We are keeping this folder empty, but created so the brain can actually save.
We aren't providing a pre-processed brain so you can train it on whatever data you want.
